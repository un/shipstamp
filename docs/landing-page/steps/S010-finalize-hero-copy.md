# S010 Finalize Hero Copy

## Headline

Stop bad commits before they become PR noise.

## One-liner

GitPreflight runs on `git commit` (or optional pre-push), reviews only `git diff --cached`, and returns stable Markdown with `suggestion` blocks your agent can apply before you push.

## Required value lines

- Tells your agent what to fix before the PR is made.
- No more copying LLM feedback back and forth between the PR and your agent.

## Theme line

1000x developers do not chase the white rabbit.

## Notes

- Tone: assertive and technical; aggressive but accurate.
- Category callouts: commit-time hook gate, staged-only review, stable agent-parseable Markdown.
- Copy is ASCII-only.
