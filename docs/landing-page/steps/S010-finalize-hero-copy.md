# S010 Finalize Hero Copy

## Headline

Clean PRs by default. Fix issues at commit time.

## One-liner

Shipstamp runs staged-only pre-commit reviews and returns stable, actionable Markdown your agent can apply before you push.

## Notes

- Tone: technical and calm; no hype.
- Category callouts: staged-only, pre-commit (git commit), agent-friendly output.
- Copy is ASCII-only.
