# S011 Draft Problem Copy

## Problem (bullets)

- Push-first review leaks half-baked diffs into PRs before the loop is done.
- Agents and bots write feedback into PR comments, not directly into your local fix loop.
- Developers copy review output back into agents, then push another speculative patch.
- PR threads become review archaeology: noise, retries, and repeated nits.
- Humans review cleanup churn instead of the intended change.

## Short intro line (optional)

You push code, bots pile onto the PR, and now your agent is stuck reading thread noise instead of fixing code.
